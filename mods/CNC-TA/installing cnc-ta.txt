Installing C&C:TA files.

Make sure you have 
-TA v3.0 or newer installed. v3.1 recommended
-NO other third party units, not even Unlimited Units' normal TA units installed.
-NO other Total Conversions or races installed, or you might have to make some backup files.
-TA:CC installed (Not necessary but recommended, just for sure)
-TA that has been working properly so far
-NO Boneyards installed.

If one or more of the above do not match your TA, you might have errors, conflicts, etc.

To Install C&C:TA files, follow the next installation steps.

STEP 1.
-You should have an empty TA directory now. With empty I mean no other units installed than Cavedog's units, the originals. Reinstalling or just installing another TA for C&C:TA is always recommended to easily avoid any problems.
-Extract all files with UFO extension (eg. sounds.ufo) (Or HPI files in future) to your TA directory, just like you do to all other UFO and HPI files.

STEP 2.
-If your TA directory doesn't have a subdirectory called Gamedata, then create one. Extract files sound.tdf and sidedata.tdf to that directory. (There might be more TDF files in future, so extract all of them into the Gamedata subdir)
-If you already have the subdirectory Gamedata and some other files with the same name there, it is better to make a backup copy of your previous files. 
-These files have info on the playing sides and sounds. (And some other stuff in future, maybe?)

STEP 3.
-Start up your TA and run a skirmish game and if you did everything right you should have a Mobile Headquarters unit instead of the usual commander in the beginning.
-In case you couldn't get the C&C:TA working, you can mail Hitman Neverlose at
