			    Regarding the Imperial Troop Transport 
			       and Rebel Loratus Hover Transport:


The Troop Transport and Loratus Transport feature an advanced unloading script designed to
minimize the work needed to unload units. Traditional Total Annihilation transports require
clicking once to unload each individual unit; this requires upwards of 20 mouse actions in
order to unload a full transport. The SWTA transports, on the other hand, will immediately
unload all their contents upon the first Unload command. They will do so in two "modes":

1. When the transport is ON, it will unload its contents in a five-wide block formation.
Infantry (and droids) will be placed side-by-side, five in a row, for as many rows as needed.
If an unloading area is blocked by terrain or other units, the transport will continue to
deploy units further and further away.

2. When the transport if OFF, it will unload troopers in ring formations around itself.
It will place up to 10 troopers in each ring, again depending on terrain blockage, and
continuing to add rings as long as there are more troopers to unload.

Additionally, each transport has a medium cannon that can only be fired when at least five
troopers are loaded into the transport.
