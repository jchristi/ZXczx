1) Intallation/Deinstallation instructions
------------------------------------------
a) How to Install ?
-------------------
First of all TLL need TA v.3.1 and TA:CC. 
I also recomend you make a seperate install of TA. Just copy and paste your \TOTALA directory 
in the new one (\TOTALA TLL for exemple).

Make sure Total Annihilation is installed that way :
-----------------------------------------------------
1: Install Total Annihilation(if you haven't already).
2: Install TA: Core Contingency(if you haven't already).
3: Install the Cavedog 3.1 patch.
4: Make sure you DO NOT have all Cavedog post 3.1 units (Necro,etc...) installed 

Then Install The Lost Legacy Following this order :
---------------------------------------------------
4: Remove the Cavedog rev31.gp3 file and the revision.gpf(if present) that were installed by the 3.1 patch.
5: Launch the Tllsetup.exe file. 
6: Extract all the files into your \TOTALA or \TOTALA TLL directory. (C:\Cavedog\Totala by default).
7: Launch TLL.exe,and enjoy.


a) How to Uninstall ?
-------------------
To Uninstall:

1: Remove the tllrace.ufo, tll textures.ufo, rev31.gp3, and TLL.exe files from your directory.
2: Place the Cavedog rev31.gp3 and revesion.gpf files back in your dir.


2) What's TLL ?
---------------
TLL (The Lost Legacy) is a 3rd party race designed M3G (m3g@planetannihilation.com).
To know more about the race, you can read the story at :
http://www.planetannihilation.com/TLL (story menu) You will find more on the site.
The project has started summer (2002) and is now fully operationnal.

The V1 is the latest version available, however you can find previous version on the site.

3) Known bugs !
---------------
Well, for now there's no critical bug. But the more you play, the more you find bugs ;)

For any other bug, please report them here :
	m3g@planetannihilation.com 
		or 
	TLL forums at Planet Annihilation

Describe what kind of bug it is (crash TA, unit not moving,etc...) when they appear 
(loading, in game, when the unit is just built,etc...) and if you have an error message 
write it or make a screenshot.

Thanks for reporting bugs.
