-------------------------=====DUNE:TA=====-----------------------------
You need TA patch 3.0 or newer.

Dune:TA is a total conversion for Total Annihilation. That means your TA can be changed to Dune 2 with few files. Arm will be Atreides and Core is Harkonnen. Ordos is left out because of problems with creating a third side and the Deviator missile launcher which should "capture" units for some time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Dune:TA:

Step 1
Make sure you have TA installed without any other 3rd party units.

Step 2
Download latest DTA.zip.

Step 3
Unzip the file DuneTA.ufo from the zip to your TA dir.

Step 4
If you don't have a subdirectory Gamedata in your TA directory then create one. Unzip files sidedata.tdf and sound.tdf there.

Step 5
Now you can play Dune:TA against AI or a human opponent. The AI isn't very clever opponent but at least it does something. The best way to get a good game is to wait a few minutes for the AI to build some defenses. AI is very addicted to metal (eh...Spice) and it's always after new deposits. Anyway you can also play against human opponents, which is a lot harder. Don't underestimate the AI tho.

(Step 6)
In TA options menu, disable shading or the walls and some other buildings might have black and white faces.

(Step 7)
We recommend Bordu map made by Padington. It's small but fits in with its style. Get it from TAMEC (www.tamec.org)
