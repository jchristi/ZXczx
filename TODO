TODO list
---------
_add support for team management
_read the music from a CD
_add glossiness (or reflection) to all TA3D models.
_make 3D replacement models for 2D map features
_implement standing move orders
_increase loading speed and lower memory cost by not loading unused features (done in some modules)
_add support for TTF fonts ( seems impossible due to memory restrictions )
_networking code
_improve A.I.
_D3D support

* added a test to prevent making textures that can't fit within the maximum texture size available on the OpenGL renderer (hope it'll fix the SIS bug)

bug list
--------
_sometimes weapons go through their target without hitting them !!
_There should be either restriction to use 12-icon build menu on resolutions lesser than 1024x768 or it should be sizeable, since now on 800x600 or 640xx480 size of 12-icon build menu don`t match size of othe GUI parts and covers some of function buttons.
_AI still can`t place metal extractors directly where it should be placed _add a flag to movement data to make units leaving their factory face the exit before moving
_some parts of the maps might not be drawn (visibility limit) like hills
_slow down with lots of 3D sprites on some gfx hardware (speed increased but bug not yet fixed)
_fix all other bugs ( :-) )

* fixed click on hidden widgets when floatting menus are unrolled
* enable ATI workarounds with SIS cards
* fixed gui bug with floatting menus : "when the pointer is over a floatting menu, it selects without clicking (config menu) ..."
* fixed : the second mission of arm campaign is no more won immediately ...

idea list
---------
_random map generator
_animated background in menus
_first person view to allow FPS style mods
